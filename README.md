# 100 Days of Python

This repository documents my progress through the "100 Days of Python" challenge. I started this course almost 10 months ago, aiming to improve my Python skills by working on exercises and projects every day. While I haven’t completed the full 100 days yet, this repo represents my learning journey and daily activities so far.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Python" challenge encourages consistent, daily coding practice with Python. Each folder or file in this repository corresponds to activities, exercises, or mini-projects completed on a given day.

## Structure

- Each day’s work is organized by folder or file (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.).
- Progress varies by day; some days include notes, scripts, or small projects.

## Goals

- Build consistent Python coding habits
- Explore core Python concepts and libraries
- Document and share my learning progress

## Status

*Started:* [7th September, 2024]  
*Current progress:* Ongoing (last updated: [Update date as needed])  
*Completed days:* [30-35]

## How to Use

- Browse the folders/files to see code and notes for each day.
- Use the code as reference or inspiration for your own learning.

## License

This project is for personal learning and sharing. Feel free to use the code for educational purposes.
