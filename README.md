📘 100 Days of Python – CodeWithHarry

I followed the "100 Days of Python" course by CodeWithHarry and completed a significant portion of it (around 50 days).
This course helped me strengthen my core Python skills through practical, hands-on mini-projects and exercises.
🔍 Topics I covered so far:

    ✅ Python basics and control flow

    ✅ Functions, loops, and modules

    ✅ File I/O and error handling

    ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    ✅ Working with external libraries like requests, tkinter, pygame, etc.

You can find my progress and solutions in the folders/files inside this repository. I plan to continue and complete the rest in future
